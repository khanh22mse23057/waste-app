Open dumping and open burning are the main implemented waste treatment and final disposal systems, mainly visible in low-income countries. This paper reviews the main impacts due to waste mismanagement in developing countries, focusing on environmental contamination and social issues. The activity of the informal sector in developing cities was also reviewed, focusing on the main health risks due to waste scavenging. Results reported that the environmental impacts are pervasive worldwide: marine litter, air, soil and water contamination, and the direct interaction of waste pickers with hazardous waste are the most important issues. Many reviews were published in the scientific literature about specific waste streams, in order to quantify its effect on the environment. This narrative literature review assessed global issues due to different waste fractions showing how several sources of pollution are affecting the environment, population health, and sustainable development. The results and case studies presented can be of reference for scholars and stakeholders for quantifying the comprehensive impacts and for planning integrated solid waste collection and treatment systems, for improving sustainability at a global level.},

              Background
              Poor waste disposal practices hamper the progress towards an integrated solid waste management in households. Knowledge of current practices and perception of household solid waste management is necessary for accurate decision making in the move towards a more sustainable approach. This study investigates the household waste practices and perceptions about waste management in Panji, one of the sub-districts in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia.
            
            
              Methods
              A stratified random sampling technique using a cross-sectional survey questionnaire was used to collect data. A total of 338 households were interviewed in the survey and data were analyzed using SPSS. Chi-square goodness of fit test was used to determine the relationships between categorical variables, whereas Chi-square bivariate correlation test was performed to observe the correlation between the perceptions of waste segregation with socio-demographic background of the respondents. The correlation between perception of respondents with the locality, house type and waste type were also conducted. Principal component analysis was used to identify grouping of variables and to establish which factors were interrelated in any given construct.
            
            
              Results
              The results of the study revealed that 74.3 \% of households disposed of food debris as waste and 18.3\% disposed of plastic materials as waste. The study also showed that 50.3\% of the households segregate their waste while 49.7\% did not. About 95.9\% of the respondents were aware that improper waste management leads to disease; such as diarrhea and malaria. There were associations between locality, age and house type with waste segregation practices among respondents (Chi-square test, p{\textless}0.05). Associations were also found between locality with the perception of improper waste management which lead to disease (Chi-square test, p{\textless}0.05). Principal Component Analysis showed that 17.94\% of the variance has high positive loading (positive relationship) with age, marital status and, type of house.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study highlights the importance to design waste separation programs that suit the needs of targeted population as a boost towards sustainable solid waste management practices.},

In order to realize the automation of garbage classification, some deep learning models are used for garbage images recognition. A novel garbage image recognition model Garbage Classification Net (GCNet) based on transfer learning and model fusion is proposed in this paper. After extracting garbage image features, EfficientNetv2, Vision Transformer, and DenseNet, respectively, are combined to construct the neural network model of GCNet. Data augmentation is used to expand the dataset and 41,650 garbage images are contained in the new dataset. Compared with other models through experiments, the results show that the proposed model has good convergence, high recall rate and accuracy, and short recognition time.},

	abstract = {The massive growth of population coupled with urbanization over the years has created a significant challenge of increase in waste generation. India has achieved massive developmental growth in economic and social areas but still lacks a proper waste management system. The lack of knowledge about segregation of waste into different categories and proper disposal techniques in a country like India with an accelerated population growth is a critical issue. Since trash has different disposal techniques, according to its type, segregating waste through an automated process at the point of collection will streamline the process and result in effective waste management and utilization. The mini-review article evaluates the recent literature on technologies used for municipal waste segregation and management, with the motive of providing critical information for advancement in current research. This article reviews the use of various convolutional neural network architectures for waste classification and describes in detail as to why image processing methods are preferred over sensors for segregation into respective categories. It is also important to have an efficient waste monitoring and management system for proper disposal. A comprehensive mini-review was undertaken to understand internet of things-based models proposing efficient waste handling, from the perspective of reduced costs, collection time and optimized routes. The proposed systems were compared and evaluated based on the sensors used monitoring, microcontrollers and communication protocols such as Long Range, Global System for Mobile Communication, Zigbee and Wi-Fi, which are employed for the secure and efficient data transmission.},

In this work, we propose DeepWaste, an easy-to-use mobile app, that utilizes highly optimized deep learning techniques to provide users instantaneous waste classification into trash, recycling, and compost. We experiment with several convolution neural network architectures to detect and classify waste items. Our best model, a deep learning residual neural network with 50 layers, achieves an average precision of 0.881 on the test set.

            With the increase in garbage production, the problem of garbage pollution is becoming more and more serious. Garbage recognition and classification can reduce the environmental burden, but there are still some challenges. Image classification, an image processing method that separates different categories of objects according to different characteristics reflected in the image information. This paper collected and produced an image data set with 2313 photos of different office garbage, and proposed an intelligent classification garbage can to solve the realistic problems. That method based on transfer techniques to retain the excellent feature extraction ability of the Inception-v3 model of TensorFlow, which can recognize objects through the convolutional neural network model. The experimental results showed that the garbage classification effect was obvious and the average accuracy rate reached 95.33\%.},

However, the vast majority of domestic waste is still not properly sorted and put out, and the disposal of domestic waste still relies mostly on manual classification. The research in this paper applies deep learning to this persistent problem, which has important significance and impact. The domestic waste is classified into four categories: recyclable waste, kitchen waste, hazardous waste and other waste. The garbage classification model trained based on MobileNetV2 deep neural network can classify domestic garbage quickly and accurately, which can save a lot of labor, material and time costs. The absolute accuracy of the trained network model is 82.92\%. In comparison with CNN network model, the classification accuracy of MobileNetV2 model is 15.42\% higher than that of CNN model. In addition, the trained model is light enough to be better applied to mobile.},
